## Introduction

The automotive industry is one of the most dynamic and competitive sectors globally, where pricing strategies are crucial for market success. This project aims to develop a predictive model for car prices and analyze sales patterns to understand market dynamics and consumer behavior.

## Project Objectives

1. Develop a predictive model to accurately estimate car prices based on various attributes.
2. Conduct a comprehensive sales analysis to gain insights into market dynamics and consumer behavior.
3. Visualize critical key performance indicators (KPIs) related to car sales using Power BI.

## Methodology

The project employs a combination of statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms. The steps involved are:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training and Validation
5. Sales Analysis
6. Visualization and Dashboard Development

## Machine Learning Models

The primary machine learning algorithm used is Linear Regression.

## Sales Analysis

The sales analysis will explore:
- Sales trends over time
- Average Price Analysis
- Cars Sold Metrics
- Impact of external factors such as economic conditions and regulatory changes

## Visualization

A Power BI dashboard will be developed to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and sales data, providing an interactive way to monitor progress, identify trends, and make informed decisions.
